# Sound Recording App

This is a simple Python sound recording app that allows you to record audio and save it as a WAV file. The app uses the `sounddevice` library for recording and the `scipy.io.wavfile` module for writing the audio data to a WAV file.

## Prerequisites

Before using the app, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- sounddevice
- scipy

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install sounddevice scipy
